# readyPlayer42

This is our team contribution to the hackathon ready player 42. Our game mostly designed to be played on a phone. The rules are very basic:  
1. Players can join a "room" with a code or scanning a qr.
2. Once in the room, the purpose is to take pictures of things that appear on screen. For example "two round objects".
3. Taking the pictures is how you achieve points. And when the time runs out, the player with the most points wins. Obviously, the pictures are validated.
